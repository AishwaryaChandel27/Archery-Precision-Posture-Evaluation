# AI-Powered Archery Form Analysis 

A comprehensive computer vision-based application that analyzes archery technique and provides detailed biomechanical feedback to help archers improve their form, posture, and shooting consistency.

## Problem Statement and Approach

### Problem Statement
Traditional archery coaching relies heavily on human observation, which can be subjective and may miss subtle biomechanical inefficiencies. Many archers struggle to identify and correct form issues that affect their accuracy and consistency. Manual video analysis is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge to provide actionable feedback.

### Our Approach
This application leverages advanced computer vision and biomechanical analysis to provide objective, data-driven feedback on archery technique. The system:

1. **Computer Vision Pipeline**: Uses MediaPipe's pose estimation to detect and track key anatomical landmarks throughout the shooting sequence
2. **Phase-Based Analysis**: Automatically segments the shooting sequence into distinct phases (stance, draw, anchor, release, follow-through) for targeted analysis
3. **Biomechanical Evaluation**: Applies archery-specific biomechanical principles to evaluate form quality, consistency, and technique
4. **Intelligent Feedback Generation**: Provides personalized recommendations with specific drills and training plans based on detected issues

## Explanations of Complex Logic/Algorithms

### 1. Pose Detection and Landmark Extraction

**Implementation**: `pose_analyzer.py`

The system uses MediaPipe's pose estimation model with high complexity settings for maximum accuracy:

```python
self.pose = self.mp_pose.Pose(
    static_image_mode=False,
    model_complexity=2,  # Highest accuracy model
    enable_segmentation=False,
    min_detection_confidence=0.5,
    min_tracking_confidence=0.5
)
```

**Special Considerations**:
- **Frame-by-frame processing**: Each video frame is analyzed independently to capture subtle movement variations
- **Coordinate normalization**: All landmarks are normalized to handle different video resolutions consistently
- **Visibility filtering**: Low-confidence detections are filtered out to improve analysis reliability

### 2. Automatic Phase Detection Algorithm

**Implementation**: `biomechanical_analyzer.py -> _detect_phase_boundaries()`

The system automatically identifies archery phases using a multi-step approach:

1. **Motion Analysis**: Tracks draw length changes over time using hand positions
2. **Smoothing**: Applies moving average filtering to reduce noise in motion data
3. **Peak Detection**: Identifies key transition points:
   - Draw start: When significant motion begins
   - Anchor phase: When draw length stabilizes near maximum
   - Release point: Sudden drop in draw length

**Algorithm Logic**:
```python
# Find draw length peaks and valleys
draw_start = self._find_motion_start(smoothed_motion)
anchor_start = self._find_anchor_phase(smoothed_motion)
release_start = self._find_release_point(smoothed_motion)
```

**Special Considerations**:
- **Fallback mechanisms**: If motion detection fails, uses time-based phase division
- **Adaptive thresholds**: Adjusts detection sensitivity based on video characteristics
- **Temporal constraints**: Ensures realistic phase durations based on archery biomechanics

### 3. Biomechanical Scoring Algorithm

**Implementation**: `biomechanical_analyzer.py -> Phase Analysis Methods`

Each archery phase is scored using weighted metrics based on biomechanical principles:

**Stance Analysis**:
- **Stance width**: Optimal range (15-25% of body width)
- **Spine alignment**: Deviation from vertical (0-10 degrees)
- **Shoulder level**: Difference between shoulder heights

**Draw Analysis**:
- **Path consistency**: Coefficient of variation in draw trajectory
- **Speed variation**: Standard deviation of draw speed
- **Elbow positioning**: Angle relative to shoulder line

**Scoring Formula**:
```python
score = base_score * consistency_factor - penalty_deductions
```

**Special Considerations**:
- **Phase-specific weights**: Different aspects weighted based on their importance in each phase
- **Consistency emphasis**: Higher weight on consistency metrics vs. absolute values
- **Progressive penalties**: Non-linear penalty system for major form deviations

### 4. Feedback Generation System

**Implementation**: `feedback_generator.py`

The system uses a template-based approach with intelligent issue prioritization:

**Issue Prioritization**:
```python
self.issue_priorities = {
    'stance': {'safety': 3, 'accuracy': 2, 'consistency': 2},
    'draw': {'safety': 2, 'accuracy': 3, 'consistency': 3},
    # ... other phases
}
```

**Template Matching**: Issues are mapped to specific feedback templates containing:
- Problem description
- Specific recommendations
- Practice drills
- Training progressions

**Special Considerations**:
- **Safety prioritization**: Safety-related issues are automatically elevated in priority
- **Personalized recommendations**: Feedback adapts based on skill level inferred from overall scores
- **Progressive training plans**: 6-week structured improvement plans based on identified issues

### 5. Data Consistency and Reliability

**Quality Assurance Measures**:
- **Pose confidence filtering**: Frames with low pose detection confidence are excluded from analysis
- **Outlier detection**: Statistical methods identify and handle anomalous measurements
- **Smoothing algorithms**: Temporal smoothing reduces noise while preserving important motion characteristics
- **Multi-frame validation**: Critical measurements are validated across multiple consecutive frames

**Error Handling**:
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues analysis even if some features fail
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed error tracking for debugging and improvement
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Alternative calculation methods when primary algorithms fail
